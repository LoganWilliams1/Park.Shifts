# Park.Shifts
ParkShifts is a web app for scheduling work shifts. Users send their monthly availability to a manager, the manager makes a schedule with an intuitive visual dashboard, and the schedule is sent back to the team.

Inspired by and designed for the crew at Lake Crabtree County Park in Cary, North Carolina
